# qlearning_ddqn_cartpole

This project implements Q-learning with the DDQN trick. This problem is solved for a simple environment called the CartPole https://stanford.edu/ jeffjar/cartpole.html. Implementation is in PyTorch. Epsilon-greedy exploration and a neural network for Q-learning have been used.

OpenAI Gymâ€™s version of CartPole, has been used - https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic control/cartpole.py to understand the environment.
